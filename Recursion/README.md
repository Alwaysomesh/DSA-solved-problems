<h1 align="left">Recursion in Java</h1>
<p>Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This approach is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into simpler, repetitive tasks. In this repository, you’ll find 50 solved recursion problems implemented in Java, showcasing various applications and patterns of recursive algorithms.</p>

<h3 align="left">Problem 01:</h3>
You are given a sorted array of integers and a target integer. Your task is to implement a recursive binary search algorithm to find the index of the target integer in the array. If the target integer is not present in the array, the algorithm should return -1.<br>

<h3 align="left">Problem 02:</h3>
You are given a set of items, each with a value, weight, and quantity. Your task is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items to include in a knapsack of a given capacity. Each item can be included in the knapsack multiple times, but not more than its given quantity. The goal is to maximize the total value in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity. This problem is a variation of the fractional knapsack problem, where items can be divided, but with a bounded quantity for each item.<br>
